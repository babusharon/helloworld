        <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
        Not in Loud miracle<br>
        And not in thunder,<br>
        Voices whispered the truth at the foot.<br>
        Your pain, he carried willingly.<br>
        Amidst the silence, he spoke life.<br>
        Still he chose us.<br>
        Kindness held the nails, not force.

      <div class="page-title">Page 2: How I Started Observing the Psychology of Women üë©</div>

      <p>To explain this, I need to go back to my childhood‚Äîthe summer vacations...</p>
      <p>That sentence didn‚Äôt TRIGGER in my mind then‚Äîbut it stayed somewhere in my brain.</p>

      <div class="page-title">Page 3: The Trigger</div>

      <ol>
        <li>Why today, I am forcefully writing ‚úçÔ∏è</li>
        <li>Who TRIGGERED my mind to recall things that happened long ago?</li>
        <li>Why am I TRIGGERED?</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="note">
        Hey reader from the other side,<br>
        I feel sleepy now üò¥ and I need more freshness to write Page 3.<br>
        So this is just the beginning of something more‚Ä¶<br>
        <strong>Wait for tomorrow.</strong>

      <div class="page-title">Page 4: Journey Break</div>

      <p>The three questions I asked earlier came from my heart. Now, my brain is joining in‚Äîwondering whether I should disclose them or not. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the writing break.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, I find myself revisiting the actions I‚Äôve taken in the past. Right now, I‚Äôm on a different kind of break‚Äînot a writing break, but a journey break.</p>
      <p>I came by train‚Äîsleeper class, 8-seat compartment. The journey began with a cup of tea inside the station at 5 PM. Train was scheduled at 5:20 or so.</p>
      <p>We laughed. Every journey should start with a smile. Why so serious all the time?</p>
      <p>I looked outside. Two men stood in the middle of the coach. Eyes closed. Shoulder bags. Sticks in hand‚Äîbut not touching the floor. Balanced.</p>
      <p>I felt uneasy. But my brain reminded me‚Äîit‚Äôs their routine. I had to be careful even to walk to the washroom. Life teaches through experience.</p>
      <p>Why do I get emotional about strangers on trains? Because trains appear at key moments in my life. There‚Äôs a bond between me and trains since childhood.</p>
      <p>My mom said I cried nonstop on a train as a baby. A stranger‚Äîa fisherwoman‚Äîtook me, walked away singing a lullaby. I disappeared. She returned later‚Äîwith me sleeping peacefully.</p>
      <p>As I write, it‚Äôs 5:56 AM. This writing is making me sleepy. I can sleep in three tenses. Now that I‚Äôm grown up, that crying story is a family favorite. Try imagining it‚Äîyou might smile too.</p>

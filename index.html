    <div class="page-title">Page 2: How I Started Observing the Psychology of Women 👩</div>

    <p>
      To explain this, I need to go back to my childhood—the summer vacations. During those days, I used to visit my mother’s home.
      For me, it was a chance to meet my cousins, while for my mom, it was about visiting her parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always looked forward to seeing my brothers there. They had this way of breaking through my silence and shyness shortly after we met.
      We played all kinds of games together. Indoor games like carrom (not chess!), and outdoor sports like cricket.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result? I lost to my brothers in carrom—well, they played it regularly, so that wasn’t a surprise. But in cricket, even though I played often at school, I failed.
      Still, my brothers were surprised by some of my cricket shots, even when they bowled at medium pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the games, we discussed studies. Now, our minds were calm, composed, and sharpened.
      (I won’t reveal my cousins’ real names here, so I’ll call them <strong>B1</strong>, <strong>B2</strong>, and <strong>B3</strong> according to their age—B3 being the youngest, and then me.)
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Hey Shar, who’s the topper in your class?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “I am.” (My class had only 6 boys and 3 girls.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Then what about the girls? What are they doing there?” (B1 and B3 laughed.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “One girl is in second place.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B3:</strong> (smiling) “How is she? What’s her name?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena.” (Name changed for privacy.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she beautiful?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> (blushing) “Ha.. Yes.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “What’s her full name?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena Thampi.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Christian?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Yes.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she really beautiful?”</div>

    <p>
      At this point, I fully understood what was going on. They were trying to link me to her, to tease me as if I had a crush.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Ha! She sits on the boys’ bench near me and my friend.
      During a festival at the temple, Mom bought some bangles and asked me to give them to her when school reopened.”</div>

    <p>
      I still remember the happiness on my brothers’ faces after I said that. There was no mockery in their smiles.
      How clearly our little brother tried to understand the situation and gave a wonderful reply—and they loved the friendship between me and Teena.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B3 (later):</strong> “Hey Shar, do you believe Teena plays any kind of tricks to overtake you in studies?
      Maybe not now, but later—you will understand. So watch girls from a long distance.”</div>

    <p>
      (That sentence didn’t TRIGGER in my mind then—but it stayed somewhere in my brain.)
    </p>

    <div class="page-title">Page 3: The Trigger </div>

    <ol>
      <li>Why today, I am forcefully writing ✍️</li>
      <li>Who TRIGGERED my mind to recall things that happened long ago?</li>
      <li>Why am I TRIGGERED?</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
      Hey reader from the other side,<br>
      I feel sleepy now 😴 and I need more freshness to write Page 3.<br>
      So this is just the beginning of something more…<br>
      <strong>Wait for tomorrow.</strong>

<p>
  The above three questions come from my heart, now being discussed with my brain—whether I need to disclose them or not.  
  Why am I thinking like that now?  
  Maybe because of the writing break.
</p>

<p>
  Breaks are always good for refreshing our minds.  
  Time to start thinking about what to do next.  
  Sometimes, I reflect on the actions I took in the past.
</p>

<p>
  Now I’m on a different kind of break—not a writing break, but a journey break, heading home.  
  I took a break from work to visit my home.  
  I came by train—sleeper class, 8-seat compartment.
</p>

<p>
  The journey began with a cup of tea from inside the railway station.  
  It was around 5 in the evening, and the train was scheduled at 5:20—or something like that.  
  I needed to find the platform number. Found it. Started walking.  
  A train was already waiting there.  
  I thought it might be another train going somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
  But then I saw the destination on the side of one of the coaches—the start and end stations of the journey.  
  Usually, this train starts from a different station, but today it started from the second station—where I was standing.
</p>

<p>
  “Why?” my friends, who were also traveling home, asked me.  
  I replied, “Indian Railways already knew we’re traveling today—that’s why!”  
  They laughed at my answer. I laughed too.
</p>

<p>
  Every journey should start with a smile.  
  Why so serious all the time?
</p>

<p>
  We drank water from a bottle we bought at the platform.  
  Thirst—almost gone.  
  It wasn’t hot outside. The train started moving.
</p>

<p>
  After a while, I looked out to see how fast the train was going.  
  Adrenaline rushed in. I felt comfortable.
</p>

<p>
  I turned my head to the left—I could see both doors were open.  
  Two men were standing in the middle of the compartment.  
  I noticed sticks in their hands and shoulder bags.  
  I looked at their faces—their eyes were closed.
</p>

<p>
  I observed them closely.  
  They were simply balancing their bodies by stretching their legs.  
  The stick wasn’t even touching the ground.  
  They were fully focused on picking small snack packets from their shoulder bags to sell.
</p>

<p>
  I felt uncomfortable with the train’s speed and the doors open on both sides.  
  My brain reminded me—they’ve been doing this for a long time.  
  They know how to stand, walk… no need to worry.  
  It’s their daily routine.
</p>

<p>
  But you need to be careful while standing or walking to the washroom on a moving train—because you don’t have the experience.  
  Some experiences really teach us in life.
</p>

<p>
  My thoughts were interrupted when they started walking.  
  Why do I get emotional about strangers during train journeys?
</p>

<p>
  Maybe because trains appear during important moments in my life.  
  No, that’s not the only reason.  
  I think it’s the emotional attachment between me and trains—ever since I was a baby in arms.
</p>

<p>
  “How can a baby remember train journeys?” you might ask.  
  Yes, I can—through my mother’s words.
</p>

<p>
  When I was a baby, I often had to visit the hospital.  
  Not a nearby one—but a well-established one.  
  That meant train journeys were needed sometimes.
</p>

<p>
  During one such journey, I started crying badly.  
  Mom was confused by the tune of my crying.  
  My dad was there too.  
  They tried to calm me—but nothing worked.  
  We were on a running train. People were looking at my parents.
</p>

<p>
  A woman from somewhere on the train came over and asked if she could hold me.  
  They handed me over.  
  But who was she?
</p>

<p>
  She picked me up and started walking away from my parents, singing a lullaby.  
  She disappeared from their sight—and I disappeared from their hearing.
</p>

<p>
  They sat there.  
  Time expired.  
  She didn’t return even after a long while.
</p>

<p>
  My dad asked the passengers, “Where did she go?”  
  Most of them were regular travelers.  
  One of them said, “Don’t worry, she’s a fisherwoman.  
  She’s a regular passenger.  
  She’ll come back once your baby stops crying.”
</p>

<p>
  After some time, she did return—with me, peacefully asleep.
</p>

<p>
  In this train journey—from office to home—I also felt sleepy.  
  Now it’s 5:56 in the morning (while writing).  
  I feel sleepy due to this writing, and I am planning to sleep.
</p>

<p>
  And I can sleep in the three tenses.
</p>

<p>
  Now that I’ve grown up, that crying incident has become a funny story in my family.  
  How?  
  Try to imagine it.  
  If you can, maybe you’ll laugh too.

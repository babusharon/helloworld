      <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      Not in Loud miracle<br>
      And not in thunder,<br>
      Voices whispered the truth at the foot.<br>

    <div class="page-title">Page 2: How I Started Observing the Psychology of Women 👩</div>

    <p>
      To explain this, I need to go back to my childhood—the summer vacations. During those days, I used to visit my mother’s home.
      For me, it was a chance to meet my cousins, while for my mom, it was about visiting her parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always looked forward to seeing my brothers there. They had this way of breaking through my silence and shyness shortly after we met.
      We played all kinds of games together. Indoor games like carrom (not chess!), and outdoor sports like cricket.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result? I lost to my brothers in carrom—well, they played it regularly, so that wasn’t a surprise. But in cricket, even though I played often at school, I failed.
      Still, my brothers were surprised by some of my cricket shots, even when they bowled at medium pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the games, we discussed studies. Now, our minds were calm, composed, and sharpened.
      (I won’t reveal my cousins’ real names here, so I’ll call them <strong>B1</strong>, <strong>B2</strong>, and <strong>B3</strong> according to their age—B3 being the youngest, and then me.)
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Hey Shar, who’s the topper in your class?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “I am.” (My class had only 6 boys and 3 girls.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Then what about the girls? What are they doing there?” (B1 and B3 laughed.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “One girl is in second place.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B3:</strong> (smiling) “How is she? What’s her name?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena.” (Name changed for privacy.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she beautiful?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> (blushing) “Ha.. Yes.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “What’s her full name?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena Thampi.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Christian?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Yes.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she really beautiful?”</div>

    <p>
      At this point, I fully understood what was going on. They were trying to link me to her, to tease me as if I had a crush.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Ha! She sits on the boys’ bench near me and my friend.
      During a festival at the temple, Mom bought some bangles and asked me to give them to her when school reopened.”</div>

    <p>
      I still remember the happiness on my brothers’ faces after I said that. There was no mockery in their smiles.
      How clearly our little brother tried to understand the situation and gave a wonderful reply—and they loved the friendship between me and Teena.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B3 (later):</strong> “Hey Shar, do you believe Teena plays any kind of tricks to overtake you in studies?
      Maybe not now, but later—you will understand. So watch girls from a long distance.”</div>

    <p>
      (That sentence didn’t TRIGGER in my mind then—but it stayed somewhere in my brain.)
    </p>

    <div class="page-title">Page 3: The Trigger </div>

    <ol>
      <li>Why today, I am forcefully writing ✍️</li>
      <li>Who TRIGGERED my mind to recall things that happened long ago?</li>
      <li>Why am I TRIGGERED?</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
      Hey reader from the other side,<br>
      I feel sleepy now 😴 and I need more freshness to write Page 3.<br>
      So this is just the beginning of something more…<br>
      <strong>Wait for tomorrow.</strong>
    </div>

	<div class="page3 remaining">Page 3: The Trigger (remaining)</div>

		

<p>
  The above three questions come from my heart, now being discussed with my brain—whether I need to disclose them or not.  
  Why am I thinking like that now?  
  Maybe because of the writing break.
</p>

<p>
  Breaks are always good for refreshing our minds.  
  Time to start thinking about what to do next.  
  Sometimes, I reflect on the actions I took in the past.
</p>

<p>
  Now I’m on a different kind of break—not a writing break, but a journey break, heading home.  
  I took a break from work to visit my home.  
  I came by train—sleeper class, 8-seat compartment.
</p>

<p>
  The journey began with a cup of tea from inside the railway station.  
  It was around 5 in the evening, and the train was scheduled at 5:20—or something like that.  
  I needed to find the platform number. Found it. Started walking.  
  A train was already waiting there.  
  I thought it might be another train going somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
  But then I saw the destination on the side of one of the coaches—the start and end stations of the journey.  
  Usually, this train starts from a different station, but today it started from the second station—where I was standing.
</p>

<p>
  “Why?” my friends, who were also traveling home, asked me.  
  I replied, “Indian Railways already knew we’re traveling today—that’s why!”  
  They laughed at my answer. I laughed too.
</p>

<p>
  Every journey should start with a smile.  
  Why so serious all the time?
</p>

<p>
  We drank water from a bottle we bought at the platform.  
  Thirst—almost gone.  
  It wasn’t hot outside. The train started moving.
</p>

<p>
  After a while, I looked out to see how fast the train was going.  
  Adrenaline rushed in. I felt comfortable.
</p>

<p>
  I turned my head to the left—I could see both doors were open.  
  Two men were standing in the middle of the compartment.  
  I noticed sticks in their hands and shoulder bags.  
  I looked at their faces—their eyes were closed.
</p>

<p>
  I observed them closely.  
  They were simply balancing their bodies by stretching their legs.  
  The stick wasn’t even touching the ground.  
  They were fully focused on picking small snack packets from their shoulder bags to sell.
</p>

<p>
  I felt uncomfortable with the train’s speed and the doors open on both sides.  
  My brain reminded me—they’ve been doing this for a long time.  
  They know how to stand, walk… no need to worry.  
  It’s their daily routine.
</p>

<p>
  But you need to be careful while standing or walking to the washroom on a moving train—because you don’t have the experience.  
  Some experiences really teach us in life.
</p>

<p>
  My thoughts were interrupted when they started walking.  
  Why do I get emotional about strangers during train journeys?
</p>

<p>
  Maybe because trains appear during important moments in my life.  
  No, that’s not the only reason.  
  I think it’s the emotional attachment between me and trains—ever since I was a baby in arms.
</p>

<p>
  “How can a baby remember train journeys?” you might ask.  
  Yes, I can—through my mother’s words.
</p>

<p>
  When I was a baby, I often had to visit the hospital.  
  Not a nearby one—but a well-established one.  
  That meant train journeys were needed sometimes.
</p>

<p>
  During one such journey, I started crying badly.  
  Mom was confused by the tune of my crying.  
  My dad was there too.  
  They tried to calm me—but nothing worked.  
  We were on a running train. People were looking at my parents.
</p>

<p>
  A woman from somewhere on the train came over and asked if she could hold me.  
  They handed me over.  
  But who was she?
</p>

<p>
  She picked me up and started walking away from my parents, singing a lullaby.  
  She disappeared from their sight—and I disappeared from their hearing.
</p>

<p>
  They sat there.  
  Time expired.  
  She didn’t return even after a long while.
</p>

<p>
  My dad asked the passengers, “Where did she go?”  
  Most of them were regular travelers.  
  One of them said, “Don’t worry, she’s a fisherwoman.  
  She’s a regular passenger.  
  She’ll come back once your baby stops crying.”
</p>

<p>
  After some time, she did return—with me, peacefully asleep.
</p>

<p>
  In this train journey—from office to home—I also felt sleepy.  
  Now it’s 5:56 in the morning (while writing).  
  I feel sleepy due to this writing, and I am planning to sleep.
</p>

<p>
  And I can sleep in the three tenses.
</p>
<div class="note">

  Now that I’ve grown up, that crying incident has become a funny story in my family.  
  How?  
  Try to imagine it.  
  If you can, maybe you’ll laugh too.

</div>
	  <h4> <u>Reaching Home </u></h4>

<p> 
Train reached my destination.<br/><br/> I and my friend stepped out from the train. Rainy climate, not raining now. Took an auto rickshaw to reach the bus stand. Took some money from ATM machine for bus fare. Got into a bus — a fast passenger bus. <br/><br/>

<b>During the bus journey, a WhatsApp message triggered. I smiled at the content with a <i> tricky smile</i>.</b>  <br/> <br/>


Dad was waiting to pick me from the bus stop. I reached my hometown bus stop. I stepped out from the bus. Saw my dad. He smiled. I also. I rode the bike to home; dad sat behind me. Roads were a little bit slippery due to the rainfall some time before. I shivered sometimes due to the cold in the nature. <b>I rode the bike slowly.</b><br/><br/>


 Reached the home. I just pressed the bike horn button. <b> Mom </b>opened the <u>front door </u>. I entered the home with shoes removed. She kissed my forehead with a smile. <br/> <br/>

After some time, I went to the back side of the home wearing a dhoti. <br/> <br/>

What is special about the back side of the home? <br/><br/>

Beautiful greenery in my home is there. Trees are there. Most of the time, I feel like a Miyawaki forest. <br/><br/>

I entered into the forest. Cold penetrated into my body. I stretched my upper body.<br/><br/>

Felt like <b>Bhima</b> in that forest. <br/><br/>

Returned back from there when I heard dad calling after some time. Mind is more relaxed. I started brushing my teeth. <br/><br/>

During the finishing time, I saw the plants which are planted near the well. They are planted in a straight line. Four to five are there. Almost same height. <br/><br/>

I asked dad, <b>is it that plant?</b> Separated from the plant which is standing in front of the house? He nodded his head. He was a bit confused, and I could see the wondering in his eyes. Usually, I don't ask <b>these types </b>of questions to him.<br/><br/>


What is the plant?<br/><br/>

Why did I ask the question to my dad, even though I know the plant?<br/><br/>

<b>It's because the plant is related to forest Bhima </b>. I just remembered the name Bhima before seeing it. <br/><br/>
When I saw the plant, in this context, I remembered <b>three</b> persons. One is <b>Bhima </b>; second one is <b>Draupadi </b>. <br/><br/>

 <div class="note">
      Third one? <br/> <br/>

<i>It's a woman.</i>
 But… who is <b>SHE? </b>
    </div>
<div class="page3 remaining">
	<p>I completely forgot her thoughts when I entered into my house. Mom prepared breakfast. We all ate together. After finishing the breakfast, I got into my room. It was my study room. Now there is a bookshelf, recently made with 3 rows. I looked into the bookshelf. All are my sister's college textbooks. They all are related to Finance. I remembered her. She is not at home now. She will come back Saturday evening after her job.</p>

<p>I looked into the mirror on the almira near the bookshelf. Unexpectedly, again I looked into the bookshelf. My eyes stuck on a book cover. A familiar color pattern. I couldn't read the book name due to the absence of my specs and the slight darkness in the room. I moved forward. Now I could see the name — "Rich Dad Poor Dad." I smiled.</p>

<p>Oh, she really bought it for me? Or is she also loving to read finance books? I also noticed new members in the bookshelf: "Ram c/o Anandi, " <br/>"Five Point Someone," <br/>"Orikkal," <br/>"The Forty Rules of Love."<br/></p>

<p>The second book reminded me of the "she" I forgot while entering into my home. I took the book — Chetan Bhagat's "Five Point Someone." I just looked at the front cover page. Only saw the mathematical equation on the front cover. I didn’t have time to read. I placed it back. I read exactly four lines in "Rich Dad Poor Dad," then placed it back.</p>

<p>I remembered her two times, even when I’m at my home. Who is she?</p>


	<h4>Playing with number 2</h4> 
	<p>Try to write in simple words. <br/>
	
	She is Nayana. For me, she is my chess friend from Madras. She loves reading books. She has read almost all books by Paulo Coelho and Chetan Bhagat. She is a classical dancer too.</p>

<p>How is she? She is beautiful. Her eyes are big. Her smile is beautiful. But she has 2 smiles. One is normal, and the second one is a tricky smile with her eyes. That second one is scary sometimes, even though it is beautiful.</p>

<p><b>How is your friendship going?</b><br>
(Note: I don't know whether she considers me a friend or not.)</p>

<p>Usually, I send text messages to her. She replies most of the time with reaction emojis. Sometimes she gives short replies.</p>

<p>I fell asleep 😴 due to the tiredness from the train journey. Woke up in the afternoon to have food. In the evening, I went to the temple near my home with Dad. I closed the outside gate when I entered the temple.</p>

<p><b>Is this your temple?</b><br>
No.<br>
<b>Then for what?</b><br>
It's kind of a style I am following if the temple is empty. Empty means no one. I need only a few minutes to talk with the Lords sitting there. Only me and them. No secondary persons are there. At that particular time, the Lords only heard my words from that particular temple Asura (temple name is incomplete).</p>

<p><b>Asura is outside (me).<br>
Deva is inside (Lord).</b><br>
I smiled.</p>

<p>Completed the prayer and returned home with a rush on my bike and freshness in my mind. I sat in my study room, checked Nayana's WhatsApp chats. It's a Friday. First night at my home.</p>

<p>I started the chat like this:<br>
<b>Me:</b> "Oey, do you really want to read the third page of the book?"<br>
(Time: 7:07 PM)<br>
(I purposefully waited to send the message at that exact time, but at that time I didn’t know whether it had a connection with her previous chat.)</p>

<p>She replied after some time:<br>
<b>Nayana:</b> "First you send the second page. Then the 3rd one."</p>

<p>Oh, she remembered about the pages I had sent.<br>
<b>Me:</b> "I already told the content of page 2. Anyway, I will send from page 1 to page 3."<br>
<b>Nayana:</b> "Ok."</p>

<p>Angel number struck my mind.<br>
During 2 consecutive days, I saw the angel number 11:11 PM in June.<br>
3rd day, I missed it. But that day, I chatted with Nayana.<br>
And she replied a "No" message to my question about whether she watched the movie I suggested.<br>
Reply came at 26 June, 11:11.<br>
I missed the angel number on the third day. But I could see the number again after a long time — through her WhatsApp chat.</p>

<p><b>Is the angel number trying to communicate something with me?<br>
Or is Nayana trying to communicate something with me?</b></p>

<p>I scrolled my WhatsApp chat from bottom to top.<br>
Who first said about the Psychology of Women through WhatsApp chat?<br>
Nayana. My brain said it.</p>

<p>She usually doesn’t send any messages first.<br>
That strikes.<br>
<b>Me:</b> "On which date?" (scrolling)<br>
<b>Me:</b> "On which time?" (scrolling)</p>

<p>I was really surprised with the coincidence in the time.<br>
I sent a poem-like statement to her at that time, hiding a simple thing in it.<br>
The next day, I revealed it.<br>
I think she was surprised and chatted more that night.</p>

<p>I forgot about the book The Psychology of Women.<br>
Truly, I didn’t plan to write The Psychology of Women.<br>
I just casually sent a poem-like introduction of the book, Psychology of Women, and hide something tricky to impress her in my writing.</p>

<p>After some days, Nayana asked about the remaining parts of the book during office time — through the chat in Teams, during some other conversation. I exactly forgot the date.</p>

<p>One day, I cleared the entire chat with her.<br>
But I remember some of the chat content:</p>

<p><b>Nayana:</b> "What about your book Psychology of Women?"<br>
<b>Me:</b> "It's really complicated."<br>
<b>Nayana:</b> "You easily give up before it starts."<br>
<b>Me:</b> "No, not like that. I will reveal when the correct time happens."<br>
(At that time also, I wasn’t concerned about the book.)</p>

<p>She replied something.<br>
I don't remember exactly how the chat ended in Teams.</p>

<p>But now, during the evening of Friday, I can find out something.<br>
First time — she asked two times about the book?</p>
<div class="note">
<p><b>Time to decode her psychology.<br>
Take it seriously, <b>Shar.</b></b></p>
</div>
</div>

	<h4>Part 4_ Psychology Examination</h4>

<p>Write everything in simple words.<br>
Sometimes you don't need to glorify your write. Sometimes complete victory as a writer is the reader understood what exactly means by you.</p>

<p>I remember the above words in my mind before starting writing the last part of the module; not the book — it may continue depends on my availability.</p>

<p>I am consider as a examination to myself.<br>
If I "just pass" the exam, even I am consider as a glorifying victory.</p>

<p>Before sitting into exam <b>what is the question pattern?</b></p>

<p>It is descriptive basis. You can write it in one word even if the answer is crystal clear in your mind as yes or no.</p>

<p><b>How is the marking system?</b></p>

<p></b>Each question carries 1 mark if the answer is correct.</p>

<p><b>Is there any negative marking system if the answer is wrong?</b></p>

<p>No, negative mark. (I am afraid of negative marking system)</p>

<p>(Finally the important one)<br>
	<b>What is the criteria for passing the examination?</b>
</p>

<p>The above question is personal to me. I need half of the mark in the total marks in the examination, then I consider only I passed. (6 year routine of mine)</p>

<p> <b>Who prepare the questions for the examination?</b></p>

<p>Me (Shar)</p>

<p><b>Who evaluate your answers in the examination?</b></p>

<p>Nayana.</p>

<p><b>If she is not ready to evaluate, do you consider you failed in the examination?</b></p>

<p>No, I don't lose. But it's kind of failure for me; if she is not ready to evaluate, I compensate it with my Truths behind the facts.</p>

<p>"I believe Truths will Trigger one day even if it suppressed by the lies." It's the universal truth.</p>

<p><b>How is the style of question hierarchy?</b></p>

<p>It will be easier to harder from top to bottom according to my findings.</p>

	  <div class="note">

<p>Ready for the examination?</p> 
	  </div>
	  <p><b>It's time for the examination.</b><br>
Shar, are you feeling nervous? Are you afraid of the result?</p>

<p>Maybe a little bit.</p>

<p>You are preparing the questions and the answers are validated by Nayana. Then why?</p>

<p>Even if I prepare the questions for myself and know the answers to my own questions, from the evaluator's (Nayana's) perspective or point of view, they might be wrong.</p>

<p><b>Are the questions only related to psychology?</b></p>

<p>No. A number-related question is there.<br>
That one I will get correct.</p>

<p>So much erasing happened for that number, I believe.</p>

<p>Just start the exam. Time is decaying everywhere.</p>

<p>I close my eyes, start praying to the Lords I believe in.<br>
Took my pen in my hand to write the answers.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 1</b></p>

<p><b>On which date through WhatsApp did Nayana enquire about the status of <i>Psychology of Women</i>?</b></p>

<p>10/06/2025. 7:07 PM</p>

<p>The answer is interesting to me because this chat was started by Nayana. Usually, I start the chat and she replies to my questions.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 2</b></p>

<p><b>Is Nayana a kind of person like nocturnal animals?</b></p>

<p>Yes. She is active at night like nocturnal animals.</p>

<p>Nocturnal animals often have adaptations that help them thrive in the dark, such as enhanced senses of hearing, smell, and vision.</p>

<p>(I smiled after writing the answer. Below her eyes, a dark shade is there.)</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 3</b></p>

<p><b>Is Nayana planning to move from Madras? Where?</b></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>She is planning to move from Madras and try to relocate to her own home with a work-from-home facility for some span of time.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 4</b></p>

<p><b>Is there any valid reason she asked me about the status of the book two times during the previous month of June?</b></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 5</b></p>

<p><b>Which line does she like most in the introduction part of the book <i>Psychology of Women</i>?</b></p>

<p>The 4th line:<br>
"Your pain, he carried willingly."</p>

<p>Because I strongly believe she faced some kind of psychological problems in her life or any kind of problems that disturbed her mind.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 6</b></p>

<p><b>What's her pain?</b></p>

<p>Self-doubt in her actions in life.<br>
She doubted whether she is doing the right or wrong things in her life.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 7</b></p>

<p><b>What should you do, Shar, if you are in a particular condition? (Think from her perspective.)</b></p>

<p>(Nayana's circumstances I don't know clearly, I admit that.)</p>

<p>But from her perspective, I would share the details with a psychologist.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Question 8</b></p>

<p><b>Did she share her problems with the unknown psychologist (unknown to Shar)?</b></p>

<p><b>Obviously</b>. She shared her problems. I believe it's a woman and maybe her friend in her close circle.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Exam ends.</b><br>
I can breathe now and I am waiting for the validation from Nayana.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Some questions to myself (Shar)</b></p>

<p><b>Do you really expect validation from Nayana?</b></p>

<p>No.<br>
I am only good with numbers, not good with people.<br>
They measure goodness in terms of time—how long we know each other—not in terms of depth.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><b>After the examination, what struck your mind most?</b></p>

<p>Who is the bloody psychologist friend opposite to Shar?<br>
Whether I am writing a book about women's psychology for her?</p>

<p>Is she a woman? Things are interesting.<br>
But in the history of psychology, I think Nayana is the only person who <b>forcefully</b> made someone write about the psychology of women—her chess friend Shar—when she herself was facing some problems.</p>

<p><b>Ultimately, that is a win 🏆 for me even if Nayana is not ready to validate my answers.</b></p>

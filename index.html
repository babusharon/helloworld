      <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      Not in Loud miracle<br>
      And not in thunder,<br>
      Voices whispered the truth at the foot.<br>
      Your pain, he carried willingly.<br>
      Amidst the silence, he spoke life.<br>
      Still he chose us.<br>
      Kindness held the nails, not force.

    <div class="page-title">Page 2: How I Started Observing the Psychology of Women 👩</div>

    <p>
      To explain this, I need to go back to my childhood—the summer vacations. During those days, I used to visit my mother’s home.
      For me, it was a chance to meet my cousins, while for my mom, it was about visiting her parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always looked forward to seeing my brothers there. They had this way of breaking through my silence and shyness shortly after we met.
      We played all kinds of games together. Indoor games like carrom (not chess!), and outdoor sports like cricket.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result? I lost to my brothers in carrom—well, they played it regularly, so that wasn’t a surprise. But in cricket, even though I played often at school, I failed.
      Still, my brothers were surprised by some of my cricket shots, even when they bowled at medium pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the games, we discussed studies. Now, our minds were calm, composed, and sharpened.
      (I won’t reveal my cousins’ real names here, so I’ll call them <strong>B1</strong>, <strong>B2</strong>, and <strong>B3</strong> according to their age—B3 being the youngest, and then me.)
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Hey Shar, who’s the topper in your class?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “I am.” (My class had only 6 boys and 3 girls.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Then what about the girls? What are they doing there?” (B1 and B3 laughed.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “One girl is in second place.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B3:</strong> (smiling) “How is she? What’s her name?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena.” (Name changed for privacy.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she beautiful?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> (blushing) “Ha.. Yes.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “What’s her full name?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena Thampi.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Christian?”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Yes.”</div>
    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she really beautiful?”</div>

    <p>
      At this point, I fully understood what was going on. They were trying to link me to her, to tease me as if I had a crush.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Ha! She sits on the boys’ bench near me and my friend.
      During a festival at the temple, Mom bought some bangles and asked me to give them to her when school reopened.”</div>

    <p>
      I still remember the happiness on my brothers’ faces after I said that. There was no mockery in their smiles.
      How clearly our little brother tried to understand the situation and gave a wonderful reply—and they loved the friendship between me and Teena.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue"><strong>B3 (later):</strong> “Hey Shar, do you believe Teena plays any kind of tricks to overtake you in studies?
      Maybe not now, but later—you will understand. So watch girls from a long distance.”</div>

    <p>
      (That sentence didn’t TRIGGER in my mind then—but it stayed somewhere in my brain.)
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Why today, I am forcefully writing ✍️</li>
      <li>Who TRIGGERED my mind to recall things that happened long ago?</li>
      <li>Why am I TRIGGERED?</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
      Hey reader from the other side,<br>
      I feel sleepy now 😴 and I need more freshness to write Page 3.<br>
      So this is just the beginning of something more…<br>
      <strong>Wait for tomorrow.</strong>

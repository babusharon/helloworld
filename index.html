    <h1>How I Started Observing the Psychology of Women 👩</h1>

    <section class="narration">
      To explain this, I need to go back to my childhood—the summer vacations.  
      During those days, I used to visit my mother’s home. For me, it was a chance to meet my cousins, while for my mom, it was about visiting her parents.
    </section>

    <section class="narration">
      I always looked forward to seeing my brothers there. They had this way of breaking through my silence and shyness shortly after we met.  
      We played all kinds of games together—indoor games like carrom (not chess!), and outdoor sports like cricket.
    </section>

    <section class="narration">
      The result? I lost to my brothers in carrom—they played it regularly. But in cricket, even though I played often at school, I struggled at first.  
      Still, they were surprised by some of my cricket shots, even when they bowled at medium pace.
    </section>

    <section class="narration">
      After the games, we often shifted to more serious discussions—mostly about studies. By then, our minds were calm, composed, and sharpened from all the play.  
      (I won’t reveal my cousins’ real names, so I’ll call them <strong>B1</strong>, <strong>B2</strong>, and <strong>B3</strong> according to their age—<strong>B3</strong> being the youngest, then me.)
    </section>

    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Hey Shar, who’s the topper in your class?”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “I am.” (Class had only 6 boys and 3 girls.)</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Then what about the girls? What are they doing there?” (B1 and B3 laughed.)</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “One girl is second in the class.”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B3:</strong> “How is she? What’s her name?” (smiles)</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena.” (Name changed for privacy)</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she beautiful?”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> (smiles shyly) “Yes.”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “What’s her full name?”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Teena Thampi.”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B2:</strong> “Christian?”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Yes.”</section>
    <section class="dialogue"><strong>B1:</strong> “Is she really beautiful?”</section>

    <section class="narration">
      At this point, I understood what was happening—they were teasing me, trying to see if I had a crush on her.
    </section>

    <section class="dialogue"><strong>Me:</strong> “Ha! She sits on the boys’ bench near me and my friend. During a festival at the temple, Mom bought some bangles and asked me to give them to her when school reopened.”</section>

    <section class="narration">
      I still remember the happiness on my brothers’ faces after I said that. There was no mockery—just genuine joy.  
      Even B3, the youngest, responded so wisely. That moment made me realize how relationships and expressions—especially from girls—have depth.  
      And from there, I started observing people more carefully, especially girls, not to judge, but to understand.

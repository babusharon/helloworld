    <div class="page-title">Page 4: Journey Break</div>

    <p>
      The three questions I asked earlier came from my heart. Now, my brain is joining in—wondering whether I should disclose them or not.
      Why am I thinking like this now? Maybe because of the writing break. Breaks are always good for refreshing our minds. Time to think about what to do next.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, I find myself revisiting the actions I’ve taken in the past. Right now, I’m on a different kind of break—not a writing break, but a journey break.
      I'm heading home. I took leave from work to visit my family. I came by train—sleeper class, 8-seat compartment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The journey began with a cup of tea from inside the railway station. It was around 5 in the evening. The train was scheduled to depart at 5:20—or something like that.
      First, I had to find the platform number. Once I did, I started walking. A train was already waiting there. At first, I thought it might be another train headed somewhere else.
      But then I saw the destination board on one of the coaches—it listed the start and end stations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, this train starts from another major station. But today, it began from the second one—right where I was. My friends, who were also traveling home, asked me, “Why?”
      I replied, “Indian Railways already knew we were traveling today—that’s why!” They laughed. I laughed too.
      Every journey should start with a smile. Why so serious all the time?
    </p>

    <p>
      We drank water from a bottle we’d picked up at the platform. Thirst—almost gone. The weather wasn’t too hot.
      The train started moving. After a while, I looked outside to see how fast it was going. Adrenaline rushed in—I felt comfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I turned my head to the left. Both compartment doors were open. Two men stood near the middle of the coach.
      I noticed they had sticks in their hands and shoulder bags. I looked at their faces—their eyes were closed.
      They were balancing themselves by slightly stretching their legs. The sticks weren’t even touching the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      I watched as they calmly pulled small snack packets from their bags to sell. Despite the open doors and moving train, they were completely composed.
      I felt uneasy watching them. But my brain reminded me—this is their daily routine. They’ve done this many times. They know how to stand, how to walk. It’s second nature to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still—I reminded myself—I needed to be careful if I stood or walked to the washroom. Because I didn’t have that experience.
      Some things, you only learn from living them.
    </p>

    <p>
      My thoughts were interrupted when the men began walking. And I started wondering—why do I get emotional about strangers during train journeys?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe because trains appear at important turning points in my life. No, that’s not the only reason.
      It’s something deeper. I think it’s an emotional bond between me and trains—one that goes all the way back to when I was just a baby in my mother’s arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      “How can a baby remember train journeys?” you might ask. I can—through my mother’s words.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I was very young, I had to visit a hospital regularly—not one nearby, but a reputed one far away.
      That meant train journeys. During one such journey, I cried loudly and continuously. My mom was confused by the tone of my cry.
      My dad was there too. They tried everything to calm me—but nothing worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      We were on a running train. Passengers around us started staring. Suddenly, a woman—someone unknown—approached and asked, “Can I hold him?” They agreed.
    </p>

    <p>
      She picked me up and walked away, gently singing a lullaby. She disappeared into another compartment. I disappeared from my parents’ sight—and hearing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time passed. She didn’t come back. My dad got anxious and asked other passengers, “Where did she go?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of them were regulars. One said, “Don’t worry. She’s a fisherwoman. She travels daily. She’ll come back after your baby stops crying.”
    </p>

    <p>
      And she did. After a while, she returned—with me, sleeping peacefully in her arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, on this journey—from office to home—I also felt sleepy. As I write this, it’s 5:56 in the morning. The act of writing made me drowsy.
      I’m about to sleep. And you know what? I can sleep in three tenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that I’ve grown up, that crying incident has become a funny story in my family. How? Try to imagine it. If you can, maybe you’ll laugh too.
